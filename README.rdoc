= Scopes for Associations

== Description

Define very basic, commonly used scopes for ActiveRecord associations.

== Description through code

  class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :director
    scopes_for_associations
  end
  
  Movie.for_director(Director.first)
  #=> [#<Movie ..., director_id: 1>]
  Movie.for(Director.first)
  #=> [#<Movie ..., director_id: 1>]

== Limitations

As of now, the gem only defines scopes for non-polymorphic belongs_to associations.
